## Auth flow types

`AWSCognitoAuthPlugin` allows you to switch between different auth flows while initiating signIn. You can configure the flow in the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file or pass the `authFlowType` as a runtime parameter to the `signIn` api call.
Supported auth flow types are:
- `userSRP` - Authentication flow start with Secure Remote Password (SRP) flow
- `customWithSRP` - Authentication flow start with Secure Remote Password (SRP) flow with custom lambda triggers
- `customWithoutSRP` - Authentication flow start with custom lambda triggers
- `userPassword` - Authentication flow start with migration flow

```swift
let options = AWSAuthSignInOptions(authFlowType: .customWithoutSRP)
let result = try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(username: username,
                                            options: .init(pluginOptions: options))
```
